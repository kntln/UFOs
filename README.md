## Overview of Project
For this project, a dynamic webpage was created to display the data for UFO sightings and to allow the data manipulation by adding filters. To create the dynamic webpage, JavaScript, was inserted into an HTML page. JavaScript is a front end development language that allows addition of extra functions and customizations that enhance user experience. CSS, Bootstrap and ChromeDev Tools were also used to create the webpage.

## Results
 - Using JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, and ChromeDev Tools, a webpage named UFO Sightings - The Truth is Out There was created for individuals interested in learning more about UFOs. Filter search has also been added to filter through the plethora of data.

## Summary
### Drawback
- One drawback of this webpage is that when you enter a filter value, you have to manually delete the value which can decrease user experience for web page visitors. Another drawback of the page is that the filter value has to exactly match the format of the data. For example, if you enter "US" instead of "us" for the country, the filter value will not return any results. Lastly, the data displayed on the webpage is not updated. For visitors that are looking for most recent data about UFOs, the webpage may not be the most ideal site to visit. 

### Recommendations
One recommendation for further development is to develop a feature where users do not have to manually delete the filter value. For instance, once web page visitors input the filter value and hit enter, the filter button automatically refreshes so they can enter a new value. The second recommendation is to add a feature that accommodates flexibility in terms of the format of filter value. Specifically, case senstivity can be adjusted so that variation of the filter value returns the same data. For instance if users were to enter the following variation: "US", "us", "Us", and "uS", the code can recognize that these values correspond to the same input. 
Finally, the third recommendation is to add a feature that displays images of the data, if applicable, so that users have a visual reference of the described UFO sightings.
